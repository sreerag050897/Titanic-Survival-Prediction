# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Survival Prediction on Titanic Data set

A machine learning project to predict whether a passenger in titanic disaster survived or not.
Data was imported using Pandas and basic EDA was performed using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Tried to build the model using both Logistic Regression as well as KNN algorithm.
Logistic Regression gives a better result of around 80 percentage accuracy
